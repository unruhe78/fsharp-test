(*
    Question 1: Which values are optional?
    Answer:     MiddleInitial
    General Considerations:
    - NULL is not allowed as a value is almost every functional programming language
    --> Use F# built-in type Option<'T> = Some of 'T | None
*)

    }

(*
    Question 2: What are the constraints?
    Answer:     All strings have a max. length, the email address additionally has a specific format
    General Considerations:
    - NULL is not allowed as value
    - Throwing exceptions is like *SHAME*
    --> Use built-in type Option<'T> for error handling to return "Some VALUE" in success case and "None" in error case
    --> Define SINGLE CHOICE TYPEs to use instead of primitive types (String2, String50, EmailAddress instead of plain string)
    --> Implement FUNCTIONS for checking constraints and creating the value of the specific single choice type
    --> Make use of CURRYING to avoid duplicate code

                          else None
        | None         -> None
        

(*
    Question 3: Which fields are linked?
    Answer:     (FirstName, MiddleInitial, LastName) + (EmailAddress, IsEmailVerified)
    --> Create special types to cluster linked fields
*)

module DomainModelConsideringLinkedFields =
    type PersonName = {
        FirstName:string

    type Contact = {
        Name:PersonName
        PostalAddress:PostalAddressInfo
        EmailAddress:EmailAddressInfo
    }

(*
    Question 4: What is the domain logic?
    Answer:     Rule 1: If the email address changed, then the email verified flag must be reset to false
                Rule 2: The email verified flag can only be set to TRUE by a special verfication service
                Rule 3: The contact must have at least a postal address or an email address
                Rule 4: The country must be Germany or France or USA
    General Considerations:
    - "There is no problem that can't be solved by wrapping it into another type" - Scott Wlachin
    --> Create special types to cluster linked fields

    Final Questions:
    1. How do I unwrap the single choice types to get the plain value?
    2. How do I enforce using the factory functions instead of using the types directly? aka How to define private constructors of F# types?
    3. how do I get information what went wrong in case of an error?

    Answers:
    1. Every type in F# can be 
    2. Don't make the type private, but make its value private (value is everything after the "equals" character)
    3. Introduce a custom error type and use type Result

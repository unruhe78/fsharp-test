    /// This will ignore escape characters such as '\', '\n', '\t', etc.

    /// String literals can also use triple-quotes.

    let helloWorld = string1 + " " + string2 

    // This line uses '%s' to print a string value.  This is type-safe.
    printfn "%s" helloWorld

    /// Note that like many languages, Strings are zero-indexed in F#.
    let substring = helloWorld.[0..6]
    printfn "%s" substring
